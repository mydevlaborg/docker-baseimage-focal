# An Ubuntu base image for docker and adjusted for my use

This image folder is from our fork of [Phusion baseimage-docker](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker), they did all the heavy lifting.  A big thank you for all their hard work.

You should probably use the original Phusion project unless you are looking for something modifed to suit my own needs.
